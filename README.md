# Aquarium-Simulator

### About ###
This is an aquarium simulator made with Processing 3.3. It is intended as a study of crowd movement, specifically with schools of fish. Small prey fish move in schools while the larger predator fish chase after the prey. Small fish reproduce after a certain amount of time, resulting in an egg at the bottom of the screen.
